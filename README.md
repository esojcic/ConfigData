# Communication/Transport

## KBV Core API 
- RESTful API
- uses HTTP as transport layer
- reqeust/response message format is JSON
- the services are addressed via URIs
- the request method is POST
- use token based stateless authentication

## External accessibility of the KBV Services
For external service consumers, the KBV services are protected via secured HTTP (HTTPS). However, HTTPS is not a part of the KBV Core API implementation and takes place in the cloud, when the internal resources are mapped to the external URLs and exposed. 
External consumers access the KBV services using basic authentication. The transition from basic authentication to the KBV token authetication is perfomed in the cloud and ist not a part of the KBV Core API. (TODO: What is the exact name of this mechanism? Are there documentation for this mechanism? Refer here to the documentation).

## HTTP Compression
In order to reduce the transmitted content, the KBV Core API provides the posibility to compress the content transferred to the client. There for the HTTP compression is in use. uses public domain compression algorithms, like gzip and compress
